\fBglib-gettextize\fR [option...] [directory]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
 \fBglib-gettextize\fR helps to prepare a source package for being internationalized through gettext\&. It is a variant of the \fBgettextize\fR that ships with gettext\&.

.PP
 \fBglib-gettextize\fR differs from \fBgettextize\fR in that it doesn't create an \fIintl/\fR subdirectory and doesn't modify \fIpo/ChangeLog\fR (note that newer versions of \fBgettextize\fR behave like this when called with the \fB--no-changelog\fR option)\&.
